          Weâ€™ve all seen at least one movie about flesh-eating zombies taking over (my personal
          favorite is Resident Evil), but where do zombies come from and why do they love eating
          brains so much? The word zombie comes from Haitian and New Orleans voodoo origins.
          Although its meaning has changed slightly over the years, it refers to a human corpse
          mysteriously reanimated to serve the undead. Through ancient voodoo and folk-lore
          traditions, shows like the Walking Dead were born

        If zombies did start roaming the streets, the Zombie Preparedness Team would conduct an
        investigation much like any other disease outbreak. the Zombie Preparedness Team would
        provide technical assistance to cities, states, or international partners dealing with a
        zombie infestation.
